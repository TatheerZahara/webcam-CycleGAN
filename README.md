# Using CycleGAN to perform realtime style transfer on webcam feed

An implementation of CycleGAN written and designed by [Jun-Yan Zhu](https://github.com/junyanz) and [Taesung Park](https://github.com/taesungp) to apply Monet, Vangogh, Cezanne, and Ukiyo-e artistic styles to your webcam feed. I describe the intuition and architecture of CycleGAN, while also providing a tutorial of how to code in the webcam compatability.
